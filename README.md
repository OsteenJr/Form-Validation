# Form-Validation
Implemented client-side form validation using JavaScript. The script checks for required fields, validates formats (name, phone, email), and ensures the message has sufficient length. Real-time error messages and success icons provide clear feedback, enhancing user experience and preventing bad submissions. 
Built-in regex patterns help catch formatting issues before the form is submitted.
